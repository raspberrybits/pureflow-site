                        <p>
                            Sarah's interest in clean water began during 
                            her travels to rural communities around the world, 
                            where she saw firsthand the struggles that people 
                            face in accessing clean water. She realized that many 
                            people lack access to safe drinking water and decided 
                            to create a solution that would be both effective 
                            and convenient. <br><br>Through PureFlow, Sarah seeks 
                            to provide a sustainable solution to the clean water 
                            crisis by creating water bottles that can filter out 
                            contaminants and make water safe to drink. Her innovative 
                            design has won awards and recognition in the industry, 
                            and the company has quickly grown to become a leader in 
                            the field.
